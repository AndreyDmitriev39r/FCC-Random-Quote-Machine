### User stories

* #1: I can see a wrapper element with a corresponding id="quote-box".

* #2: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="text".

* #3: Within #quote-box, I can see an element with a corresponding id="author".

* #4: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable element with a corresponding id="new-quote".

* #5: Within #quote-box, I can see a clickable a element with a corresponding id="tweet-quote".

* #6: On first load, my quote machine displays a random quote in the element with id="text".

* #7: On first load, my quote machine displays the random quote's author in the element with id="author".

* #8: When the #new-quote button is clicked, my quote machine should fetch a new quote and display it in the #text element.

* #9: My quote machine should fetch the new quote's author when the #new-quote button is clicked and display it in the #author element.

* #10: I can tweet the current quote by clicking on the #tweet-quote a element. This a element should include the "twitter.com/intent/tweet" path in its href attribute to tweet the current quote. Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the target="_blank" or target="_top" attribute on the #tweet-quote element if your tweet won't load. target="_top" will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.

* #11: The #quote-box wrapper element should be horizontally centered. Please run tests with browser's zoom level at 100% and page maximized.
